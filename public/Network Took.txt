Network Tool

A hub is a network device that broadcasts information to every device on the network.

A switch makes connections between specific devices on a network by sending and receiving data between them.

A router is a network device that connects multiple networks together.	For example, if a computer in one network wants to send information to a tablet on another network, then the information will be transferred as follows: First, the information travels from the computer to the router. Then, the router reads the destination address, and forwards the data to the intended network's router. Finally, the receiving router directs that information to the tablet.

A modem is a device that connects your router to the internet, and brings internet access to the LAN.	For example, if a computer from one network wants to send information to a device on a network in a different geographic location, it would be transferred as follows: The computer would send information to the router, and the router would then transfer the information through the modem to the internet. The intended recipient's modem receives the information, and transfers it to the router. Finally, the recipient's router forwards that information to the destination device.
